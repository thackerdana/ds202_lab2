```{r}
    choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/data/choco.csv")

```{r, fig.height = 5, fig.width =6}
    data = choco[,c("Bean_Origin", "Rating")]
    newdata = aggregate(x = data$Rating, by = list(data$Bean_Origin), FUN = mean)
    newdata = tail(newdata[order(newdata$x),],5)
    newdata
    newdata = as.matrix(newdata)
    barplot(newdata$x, names.arg = newdata$Group.1)

```


# 5.
```{r}
    data = choco[,c("Date", "Rating")]
    newdata = aggregate(x = data$Rating, by = list(data$Date), FUN = mean)
    plot(newdata)
    
```

This chart shows the relationship between the date and the ratings. In the
earlier years they had lower ratings and as time goes on you can see the
mean of the rating increase.
